# Warmth-AI
Warmth is a simple, caring AI companion that helps you track moods, reflect on your feelings, and understand emotional patterns. With vector search and smart insights, it remembers your past moments and supports you with gentle, personalized guidance every day.


A small AI friend that listens, remembers, and gently helps you understand yourself.

Warmth is a personal mood-tracking and reflection companion. You talk, it listens. You vent, it remembers. You come back tomorrow, and it actually knows what you’ve been feeling — not because of rigid rules, but because it understands the meaning behind your words.

Under the hood, Warmth mixes simple SQL storage with modern vector embeddings so it can recognize emotional patterns, find similar moments from your past, and give advice that feels personal instead of generic.

It’s not meant to be a therapy app or a productivity machine. It’s just a quiet space where your thoughts land softly — and where past you can gently help future you.
